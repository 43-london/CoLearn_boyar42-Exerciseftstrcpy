##Exercise: ft_strcpy
Allowed functions : None

Reproduce the behavior of the function strcpy (man strcpy).

Write a function called ft_strcpy that copies the string pointed to by src, including the null character '\0' at the end, to the buffer pointed to by dest. The function should also return the pointer to the destination string dest.

Here's how it should be prototyped: 
`char *ft_strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);`
